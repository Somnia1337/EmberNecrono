Networks that employ **packet switching** are called Datagram Networks.

47. Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host B has three links, of rates R1 = 500 kbps, R2 = 2 Mbps, and R3 = 1 Mbps.

1) Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the file transfer?

2) Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the throughput, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?

3) Repeat (1) and (2), but now with R2 reduced to 100 kbps.

1) 根据瓶颈链路的原理，为 500 kbps

2) 4 MB = 32 Mb，32 Mb / 500 kbps = 64 s

3) 100 kbps | 320 s

48. Consider a network, where 2 hosts are connected by 5 links and 4 relay devices. One host wants to send a file of 10M bits to the other host. The network is lightly loaded so that there are no queuing delays. The total propagation delay between the two hosts is fixed on 2000 bit times. The transmission rate of each link is 100M bps and the links are full duplexed. The process delay on hosts and relay devices are ignored. Unless indicated otherwise, all packets are received properly and in the same order as they are sent.

1) Suppose the network is a virtual circuit network and all the relay devices are virtual circuit switches. Suppose the VC set-up time is 20 ms and the whole file is transferred as one packet. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file from source to destination?

2) Suppose the network is a datagram network and all the relay devices are routers. Further suppose that a connectionless service is used and the whole file is transferred as one packet. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?

3) Now, suppose the network is a datagram network and all the relay devices are routers. Further suppose that the whole file is broken into 10 equal sized packets and a connectionless service is used. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?

4) Now, suppose the network is a datagram network. The relay device R1 is a switch, R2 is a HUB, and R3 and R4 are two routers. Further suppose that the whole file is broken into 10 equal sized packets and a connectionless service is used. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?

1) 0.02 s + 0.002 s + 0.1*5 s = 0.522 s

2) 0.002 s + 0.1*5 s = 0.502 s

3) 0.01*5 s + 0.002 s + 0.01*9 s = 0.142 s

​4) 0.01*5 s + 0.002 s + 0.01*9 s = 0.142 s

49. Consider sending a packet of 3000 bits over a path of 5 links. Each link transmits at 1000 bps. Queuing delays, propagation delay and processing delay are negligible.

(1) Suppose the network is a packet-switched virtual circuit network. VC setup time is 0.1 seconds. Suppose the sending layers add a total of 500 bits of header to each packet. How long does it take to send the file from source to destination? 

(2) Suppose the network is a packet-switched datagram network and a connectionless service is used. Now suppose each packet has 200 bits of header. How long does it take to send the file? 

(3) Suppose that the network is a circuit-switched network. Further suppose that the transmission rate of the circuit between source and destination is 200 bps. Assuming 0.02 s setup time and 200 bits of header appended to the packet, how long does it take to send the packet?

1) 0.1 s + 5*(3000+500)/1000 s = 17.6 s

2) 5*(3000+200)/1000 s = 16 s

3) 0.02 s + (3000+200)/200 s = 16.02 s
