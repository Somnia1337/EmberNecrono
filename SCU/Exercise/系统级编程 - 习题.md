Compared to a sequence of machine code instructions, a fragment of C code **may describe the same algorithm**.

Which of the following is able to describe a computation at the highest level of abstraction? **C++ code**

When using a debugger to find the cause of a program's incorrect behavior, **it is often necessary to start the program multiple times under the debugger**.

In visual C++, a win32 console application is **the simplest type of application visual C+ + can generate**.

Consider the following fragment of C++ source code.

```cpp
string msg;
unsigned int x;
int y;
cin >> msg >> x >> y;
cout << x + y;
```

Which of the following is (are) true regarding execution of the segment?

- The input statement will always take the same amount of time to execute.
- The output statement will always be executed immediately after the input statement.
- If `x` and `y` are both positive, an integer greater than both will be printed.

**none**

Which of the following visual C++ objects are contained within a "project"?

- Files
- Visual C++ solutions
- Flow charts

**i only**

Which of the following does a debugger do?

- Analyze the source code to find programming errors.
- Decode machine code generated by a compiler.
- Stop execution of a program.

**ii and iii only**

Integrated programming environments make it difficult to mix and match tools from different sources. This is **bad, because no single vendor is likely to be the source of all the best tools**.

The correct sequence of GCC compilation process is **preprocessing -> compilation -> assemble -> linking**.

The preprocessor removes the ==**comments**== from the source code.

In C, using default floating point settings, what happens when a floating-point computation results in an overflow? **A special value "infinity" is computed, testable with `_finite()`**.

Which of the following numerical operations is most likely to lead to loss of precision? **floating-point addition** (NOT multiplication)

Which of the following statements about floating-point numbers in C is true?

- Floating-point numbers are often only approximations of real numbers.
- A 32-bit float only approximates decimal fractions, but a 64-bit double represents them exactly.
- Floating-point numbers can represent any rational real number but not irrationals.

**i only**

What is the purpose of the exponent in floating point numbers? **To indicate where the decimal or binary point should be**.

What happens in a C program when an addition would cause integer overflow? **An incorrect result is produced and execution continues.**

In a computer with 4-byte words, which of the following C expressions tests whether `ptr` contains the address of a word?

- `(ptr & 3) == 0`
- `(ptr | 3) == 0`
- `(ptr % 4) == 0`

**i and iii only**

How is `-10` (decimal) represented in an 8-bit 2's complement binary format? **`11110110`**

How is `46` (decimal) represented in an 8-bit 2's complement binary format? **`101110`**

What is the value of the C expression `0x1234 & 0x5432`? **`0x1030`**

What is the value of the C expression `0x1234 ^ 0x5432`? **`0x4606`**

In C, what is the binary number `11010101` in hexadecimal? **`0xD5`**

Which of the following could be represented by one bit of information? **The position of a light switch**.

What is the output of this C code?

```c
#include
int main() {
	int c = 2 ^ 3;
	printf("%d\n", c);
}
```

**1**

What is the output of this C code?

```c
#include
int main() {
	unsigned int a = 10;
	a = ~a;
	printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

**-11**

What is the output of this C code?

```c
#include
int main() {
	if (7 & 8)
		printf("honesty");
	if ((~7 & 0x000f) == 8)
		printf("is the best policy");
}
```

**is the best policy**

What is the output of this C code?

```c
#include
void main() {
	int x = 97;
	int y = sizeof(x++);
	printf("x is %d", x);
}
```

==**x is 97**== (`sizeof()` 在编译时执行，`x++` 只是一个传递给 `sizeof()` 的表达式，它与传递 `x` 没有区别，不会实际执行 `x + 1`)
