In the following options, which does not define in protocol? **the transmission signals are digital signals or analog signals**

Which of the following nodes belongs to the network core? **a router with NAT service**

In the Internet, the equivalent concept to end systems is **hosts**.

In the Internet, end systems are connected together by **communication links**.

End systems access to the Internet through its **ISP**.

In the following options, which belongs to the network core? **routers**

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet, run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.

The protocols of various layers are called **the protocol stack**.

The lower layers of the OSI model are **physical, data link, network, transport**, in correct order.

In the OSI reference model, the upper layers of the OSI model are **session, presentation, application**, in correct order

Which of the following protocol layers is not explicitly part of the Internet protocol stack? **session layer**

The 5-PDU is called **message**.

Transport-layer packets are called **segment**.

The units of data exchanged by a link-layer protocol are called **frames**.

There are two fundamental approaches to building a network core, **circuit switching** and packet switching.

There are two classes of packet-switched networks: **datagram** networks and virtual-circuit networks.

**Store-and-forward transmission** means that the switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.

In **circuit-switched** networks, the resources needed along a path to provide for communication between the end system are reserved for the duration of the communication session.

In **packet-switched** networks, the resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand, and as a consequence, may have to wait for access to communication link.

Which of the following option belongs to the circuit-switched networks? **FDM & TDM**

In a circuit-switched network, if each link has $n$ circuits, for each link used by the end-to-end connection, the connection gets **a fraction $\large \frac{1}{n}$** of the link's bandwidth for the duration of the connection.

For **TDM**, the transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot.

The network that forwards packets according to host destination addresses is called **datagram** network.

The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to the next router is **propagation delay**.

Processing delay does not include the time to **wait to transmit the packet onto the link**.

In the following four descriptions, which one is correct? **If the traffic intensity is close to zero, the average queuing delay will be close to zero.**

Suppose, $a$ is the average rate at which packets arrive at the queue, $R$ is the transmission rate, and all packets consist of $L$ bits, then the traffic intensity is **$\large \frac{a L}{R}$**.

The traffic intensity should be no greater than **$1$**。

Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length $L$? (Ignore queuing delay, propagation delay, and processing delay.) **${\large \frac{L}{R_1}} + {\large \frac{L}{R_2}}$**

We are sending a $30$ Mbit MP3 file from a source host to a destination host. Suppose there is only one link between source and destination and the link has a transmission rate of $10$ Mbps. Assume that the propagation speed is $2 \times 10^8$ m/sec, and the distance between source and destination is $10,000$ km. Also suppose that message switching is used, with the message consisting of the entire MP3 file. How many bits will the source have transmitted when the first bit arrives at the destination? **$500,000$ bits**

> Access networks can be loosely classified into three categories: residential access, company access and **wireless** access.

> The following technologies may be used for residential access, except **FDDI**.

> Which kind of media is not a guided media? **digital satellite channel**

**F** Considering the bursty data transferring, a circuit switching network outperforms a packet switching network.

**T** There is no network congestion in a circuit switching network.

**F** Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate, and once this application starts, it will stay on for a relatively long period of time. According to the characteristic, a packet-switched network would be more appropriate for this application than a circuit-switched network.

Explain in detail how ADSL works.

```text
ADSL 技术通过在传统的电话线上创建多个信息通道来实现宽带互联网接入。具体包括以下几个关键方面：
多通道传输：ADSL 在一个单一的电话线路上生成三个分离的信息通道。这允许数据和语音信号同时在同一条电话线上传输，而互不干扰。
频段分割：ADSL 使用了一种称作离散多音调的技术，它可以将电话线路的频段划分为多个子频道。这些子频道中，低频部分用于普通老式电话服务，较高的频段则用来传输数据。
速率差异：ADSL 是一种非对称技术，意味着下行和上行的数据传输速率是不同的。一般情况下，下行速率高于上行速率。
数字与模拟转换：在传输过程中，ADSL 会将模拟信号转换为数字信号，以加密和压缩的形式通过电话线传输至用户设备，从而实现高速的数据传输。

Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an $N$-bit unit of data every $k$ time units, where $k$ is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will stay on for a relatively long period of time. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more appropriate for this application? Why?

```text
分组交换网络更适合。

1. 分组交换网络通过将数据分割成小的数据包进行传输，每个数据包独立路由和传输，可以有效利用带宽。
2. 对于应用程序启动后停留时间长的场景，分组交换可以随时响应数据传输的需求，而不需要在整个通信过程中保持电路连接。
3. 分组交换网络成本更低。
4. 使用分组交换网络，允许数据包通过不同的路径传输，即使某些链路出现故障或拥塞，数据包也可以通过其他路径到达目的地。

Give four types of delay along with an explanation of each.

```text
结点处理时延：检查分组首部并决定出链路、检查比特级差错
排队时延：取决于先于分组到达并正在排队的分组数量
传输时延：将分组的所有比特输送到出链路的耗时，即 L/R
传播时延：分组的所有比特从出链路的起点传输到下个结点的耗时，为两结点间距除以传播速率（d/s），后者通常略小于光速

Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host B has three links, of rates R1 = $500$ kbps, R2 = $2$ Mbps, and R3 = $1$ Mbps.

1. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the file transfer?
2. Suppose the file is $4$ million bytes. Dividing the file size by the throughput, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?
3. Repeat 1) and 2), but now with R2 reduced to $100$ kbps.

```text
1) 根据瓶颈链路的原理，为 500 kbps
2) 4 MB = 32 Mb，32 Mb / 500 kbps = 64 s
3) 100 kbps | 320 s

Consider a network, where 2 hosts are connected by 5 links and 4 relay devices. One host wants to send a file of $10$ Mbits to the other host. The network is lightly loaded so that there are no queuing delays. The total propagation delay between the two hosts is fixed on $2000$ bit times. The transmission rate of each link is $100$ Mbps and the links are full duplexed. The process delay on hosts and relay devices are ignored. Unless indicated otherwise, all packets are received properly and in the same order as they are sent.

1. Suppose the network is a virtual circuit network and all the relay devices are virtual circuit switches. Suppose the VC set-up time is 20 ms and the whole file is transferred as one packet. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file from source to destination?
2. Suppose the network is a datagram network and all the relay devices are routers. Further suppose that a connectionless service is used and the whole file is transferred as one packet. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?
3. Now, suppose the network is a datagram network and all the relay devices are routers. Further suppose that the whole file is broken into 10 equal sized packets and a connectionless service is used. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?
4. Now, suppose the network is a datagram network. The relay device R1 is a switch, R2 is a HUB, and R3 and R4 are two routers. Further suppose that the whole file is broken into 10 equal sized packets and a connectionless service is used. Ignoring the bits of header appended during the transmission, how long does it take to send the file?

```text
1) 0.02 s + 0.002 s + 0.1*5 s = 0.522 s
2) 0.002 s + 0.1*5 s = 0.502 s
3) 0.01*5 s + 0.002 s + 0.01*9 s = 0.142 s
​4) 0.01*5 s + 0.002 s + 0.01*9 s = 0.142 s

Consider sending a packet of $3000$ bits over a path of 5 links. Each link transmits at $1000$ bps. Queuing delays, propagation delay and processing delay are negligible.

1. Suppose the network is a packet-switched virtual circuit network. VC setup time is 0.1 seconds. Suppose the sending layers add a total of 500 bits of header to each packet. How long does it take to send the file from source to destination? 
2. Suppose the network is a packet-switched datagram network and a connectionless service is used. Now suppose each packet has 200 bits of header. How long does it take to send the file? 
3. Suppose that the network is a circuit-switched network. Further suppose that the transmission rate of the circuit between source and destination is 200 bps. Assuming 0.02 s setup time and 200 bits of header appended to the packet, how long does it take to send the packet?

```text
1) 0.1 s + 5*(3000+500)/1000 s = 17.6 s
2) 5*(3000+200)/1000 s = 16 s
3) 0.02 s + (3000+200)/200 s = 16.02 s
