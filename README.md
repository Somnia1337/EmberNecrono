**Ember** is a piece of wood or coal, etc. that continues to burn after a fire has no more flames. **Necrono** is short for **Necronomicon**, also referred to as the **Book of the Dead**, it is a fictional grimoire (textbook of magic) appearing in stories by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.

# Getting Started

I recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - the Markdown editor I've been using - to read & edit my notes, it offers an elegant and fluent experience.

Click [here](https://github.com/Somnia1337/EmberNecrono/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download all the notes and attachments into a `.zip` file, then unzip it and open the whole folder as an Obsidian vault.
