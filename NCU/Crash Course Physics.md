### Torque

Net torque changes an object's angular velocity.

A lot of the relationships and equations that apply to forces will apply to torque in a similar way.

$$\tau = F r \sin\theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between $F$ and $r$.

$$τ_{net} = α I$$

Where $α$ is the angular acceleration and $I = \sum m r^2$ is the moment of inertia.

Torques, like forces, have the ability to do work.

Like kinetic energy of translational motion: $E_{k_{tra}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, kinetic energy of rotational motion is:

$$E_{k_{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$$

Like linear momentum: $p = m v$, angular momentum is:

$$L = I ω$$

For an object to be in equilibrium, all of the forces and torques on it have to balance out.

### Statics

Young's Modulus: represents by $E$, tells how hard it is to strech or compress a material, depends on its stiffness.

$$\Delta I = \frac{1}{E} \frac{F}{A} I_0$$

Where $\Delta I$ is change in length, $E$ is elasticity, $\frac{F}{A}$ is stress(where $F$ is force applied and $A$ is cross sectional area), and $I_0$ is initial length.

The equation above applies for 2 types of stress:

- Tensile stress: streches objects out.
- Compressive stress: compresses objects.

$$strain = \frac{\Delta I}{I_0}$$

Shear stress:

Shear Modulus: represents by $G$.

$$\Delta I = \frac{1}{G} \frac{F}{A} I_0$$

Bulk Modulus: represents by $B$.

$$\Delta V = - \frac{1}{B} \Delta P V_0$$

Where $\Delta V$ is change in volume, $\Delta P$ is change in pressure, and $V_0$ is initial volume.

### Fluid at Rest

Pascal's Principle: If you apply pressure to a confined fluid, the pressure in every part of the fluid increases by that amount.

Gauge pressure $p' = \rho g \Delta h$.

Absolute pressure $p = p_0 + p'$.

Buoyant force

$$F_B = m_F g$$

Where $m_F$ is the mass of displaced fluid.

### Fluid in Motion

Equation of Continuity:

$$\frac{\Delta m_1}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta m_2}{\Delta t}$$

The mass flow rate equals anywhere in a pipe.

Another version:

$$\rho_1 A_1 v_1 = \rho_2 A_2 v_2$$

Bernoulli's Principle: The higher a fluid's velocity is through a pipe, the lower the pressure on the pipe's walls, and vice versa.

Bernoulli's Equation:

$$p + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g y = C$$

Where $y$ is the height and $C$ is a constant.

Torricelli's Theorem: The velocity of the fluid coming out of the spout is the same as the velocity of a single droplet of fluid that falls from the height of the surface of the fluid in the container.

### Simple Harmonic Motion

Maximum velocity:

$$v_{max} = \pm A \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
Period:

$$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
